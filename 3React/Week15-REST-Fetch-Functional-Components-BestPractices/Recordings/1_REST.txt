HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
apps can be created many different ways

Roy Fielding wrote an essay:
REST
Representational State Transfer

It's not a protocol of HTTP, but can be thought of the way we should use HTTP to create web services and applications.
Handles the state of a resource from one machine to another.
A resource is a noun: user...

Can be transferred with text..JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) = preferred way to transfer state of resource

Key paired entities.

JSON
representation of the account at a specific time
user can send a new state to the backend.
REST is more than just below but transferring of state between machines.
