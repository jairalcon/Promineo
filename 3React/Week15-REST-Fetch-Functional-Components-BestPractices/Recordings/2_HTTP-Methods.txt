HTTP Verb Methods
contains different types of requests

Create - POST, should expect a resource to be created
Read - GET, will read a resource of group of resources to display to client
Update - UPDATE, update resource and changes to existing resource
Delete - DELETE, should delete a resource.

When we send a network request from our computer to a server

POST & UPDATE request to create a new user   
    payload would contain username, password, ...

GET request with request data without payload, JSON request
    Give me user data with ID of 021.

DELETE, will be similar to GET and typically not include a payload

All these will help regarding REST resources.
