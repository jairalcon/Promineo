# Promineo Tech: Front-End Development Bootcamp Files

### Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to backup all I've been learning in the bootcamp. 
Having this repository helps me utilize git commands more frequently, which is great.


##### Some basic Git commands to get started are:

- echo "***repository-name***" >> README.md
- git init
- git add README.md
- git commit -m "first commit"
- ***git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git***
- git push -u origin main
