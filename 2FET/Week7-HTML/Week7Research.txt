Week 7 Research

-Choose one of your favorite websites and identify 5 different HTML elements used on the website. Make sure to include the URL in your submission.

I chose https://www.youtube.com/.

1. It had a <body></body> which contains many divs for page management.

2. The page has a <div></div> for the side bar but it's called <tp-yt-app-drawer></tp-yt-app-drawer>

3. Inside the sidebar, there's <ytd-guide-section-renderer></ytd-guide-section-renderer> (also in a div) that contains the upper portion that navigates between home, explore, shorts, subscriptions, library, history.

4. The page does have a <head></head> that contains a lot of styling and scripts.

5. The page does have <!DOCTYPE html> which does mean it is in fact written in HTML.


-What are 3 HTML elements not mentioned in any of the videos this week? What do they do and how are they used?

One element not mentioned is <legend>. This element is nested within "<fieldset> and provides a caption for the <fieldset>.

Another element not mentioned in this week's videos is <aside>. This element is used for content that's only indirectly related to the document's main content. <aside>'s are usually call-out boxes or sidebars.

Lastly, <figcaption> element is used to represent a caption or legend while describing the contents of its parent.
