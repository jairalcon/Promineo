Week 7 Research

-What is your favorite thing you learned this week?

My favorite thing learned this week are forms in HTML. As mentioned in this week's videos, we interact with forms on many websites on a daily basis. Learning the bare bones of building simple forms in HTML has been eye-opening regarding how they work.


What are 3 HTML elements not mentioned in any of the videos this week? What do they do and how are they used?

One element not mentioned is <legend>. This element is nested within "<fieldset> and provides a caption for the <fieldset>.

Another element not mentioned in this week's videos is <aside>. This element is used for content that's only indirectly related to the document's main content. <aside>'s are usually call-out boxes or sidebars.

Lastly, <figcaption> element is used to represent a caption or legend while describing the contents of its parent.
