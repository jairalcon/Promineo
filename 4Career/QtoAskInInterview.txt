From LinkedIn Post 

Harvard published a list of 38 smart questions to ask in a job interview.

My 10 favorite:

1. What types of skills is the team missing that you’re looking to fill with a new hire?

2. What metrics or goals will my performance be evaluated against?

3. What are the current goals that the company is focused on, and how does this team work to support hitting those goals?

4. What gets you most excited about the company’s future?

5. What’s different about working here than anywhere else you’ve worked?

6. Is there anything that I should read before starting that would help me have a shared understanding with my colleagues?

7. How has the company changed since you joined?

8. How does the team I’ll be part of continue to grow professionally?

9. Where have successful employees moved on to?

10. Is there anything I can clarify for you about my qualifications?

Pro Tip: Personalize and be as specific as possible.

(e.g. Instead of "Where have other successful employees moved on to?" try "Where have other successful analysts on [x] team moved on to?")
