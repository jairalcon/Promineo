Week 3 Research Assignment

1. Select five methods that can be used on an Array and describe the following for each: 1) what the method signature is, 2) what the method does, and 3) why would this method be useful (how could you use it)?

Answer:
1. array.map() 2. This method will create a new array. It creates a new array via the function being ran on every element in the called array. 3. This is useful when a developer has array(s) of data and want to return specific information from within the array. The function in the map() can be returned to a new variable or placed within the array itself, depending if you don't want to change the original array.

1. array.forEach() 2. This method loops over an array at a specific index and returns the values within the index position, but will change the original array. 3. This is useful when our function loops through the array for called data via the called function with the intention of updating the current array with the most current data.

1. array.filter() 2. This method creates a new array with elements that return as true. 3. This is useful when you don't want to change the original array. This can be useful when needing to retrieve data which meet specific conditions to put into a new array.

1. array.reduce() 2. This method runs a callback on each element of an array, in order, essentially adding the returned value from the previous calculation. 3. This is useful when a sum of all elements needs to be returned.

1. array.indexOf() 2. This method returns the first index in which an element is found in the array. If it is not present int he array, then -1 is returned. 3. This is useful when a developer wants to find an occurrence of an element. And if there isn't an occurrence then update that element.

1. array.push() 2. This method adds an element to the end of an array. It then returns the new length of the array. 3. This is useful when a developer wants to add elements to an array and needs the updated element count in the updated array. This is useful when wanting to merge two arrays into one, also.

1. array.pop() 2. This method removes the last element in an array and returns that specific element. This method does change the length of the array by -1.  3. This is useful when the last element of an array needs to be removed and displayed for the developer.

2. What is the difference between == and ===?

Answer:
"==" stands for abstract or "loose" equality. This is looking at both values and comparing to see if they are equal to each other.
"===" stand for strict or "identity" equality. This is looking for both values to be the same value as well as the same data type.
Both operators are widely used but identity/strict equality is used as the rule within the JavaScript Development community.
