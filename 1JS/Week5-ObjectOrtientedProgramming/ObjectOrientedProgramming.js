The Four Pillars of O.O.P. are ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION,
INHERITANCE, and POLYMORPHISM.

ABSTRACTION - taking the concept of motion = a vehicle moves

ENCAPSULATION - just need to know how to drive,
no what's happening under the hood.

INHERITANCE - 

POLYMORPHISM - an animal communicated different from other animals
Communication method is different:
dog barks
cat meows
bear growls


Objects can be created from Classes. An object is an instance of a class.
They are similar. There's a blueprint of a house but it's not a house.
However, a house can be build from the blueprint,
creating an instance of "a house"/ class.
