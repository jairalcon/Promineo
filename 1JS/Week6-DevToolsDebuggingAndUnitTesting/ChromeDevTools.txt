Chrome has Dev Tools that can be useful when troubleshooting.

Inspector has many tools that helps developers.
These are very useful for debugging and to view what's currently happening in the browser.
-Device Toggle: enables developer to view different mobile devices
-Console: see errors printed out, test code
-Elements: allows us to see DOM (Document Object Model)
-Sources: shows what's currently loaded on page.
-Network: shows requests that are being sent.
    --XHS will be used later in Bootcamp.
-Application: can look at local storage; caching values/variables for use later on.
